            <h1>CHINA</h1>
            <section class="faq-questions">
                <h2 id="whysource">Why should I source from China?</h2>
                <p>Simple. Because you’ll save money. Why would you pay $20 for an item when you can buy that exact same item for $5? It’s simple math.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="faq-questions">
                <h2 id="trust">Can I trust Chinese manufacturers?</h2>
                <p>Yes. Reputable and trusted factories do hundreds of thousands, or millions, of dollars of business every year and they care about their reputation. Small and large factories all want new customers and they know the only way they’re going to get new customers is by engaging in good business and being trustworthy. Red Bridge Co. also performs factory audits to determine the legitimacy and reliability of each factory.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="faq-questions">
                <h2 id="license">Do I need any special licenses or permits to buy from China?</h2>
                <p>No. However, if your cargo is worth more than $2500 you may be required to purchase a Customs Bond. This usually costs between $100-200 to show that the importer (buyer) complies with all customs regulations.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="faq-questions">
                <h2 id="howmuchmoney">Do I need a certain amount of money to start buying from China?</h2>
                <p>No. Many factories are willing to start out with smaller orders as you become more comfortable with buying from China and as your business grows.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="faq-questions">
                <h2 id="difficult">Is it difficult to buy from China?</h2>
                <p>No. Not when you partner with Red Bridge Co. and follow our expertise. Otherwise, if you have no experience in importing from China, then yes it can be very difficult.</p>

                <h2 id="find">How does Red Bridge Co. find its factory sources?</h2>
                <p>By way of our vast network of professional and personal connections throughout China.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="faq-questions">
                <h2 id="charge">What does Red Bridge Co. charge in exchange for its services?</h2>
                <p>A commission of the total purchase order. Even with our modest commission, the client always comes out saving big in the end and receiving top-notch service and guidance through the whole process.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="faq-questions">
                <h2 id="commission">When will I have to pay a commission?</h2>
                <p>Only when you actually release the order from China. Everything before that is free of charge.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="faq-questions">
                <h2 id="hardwithwork">Is it hard to start working with Red Bridge Co.? How do we start?</h2>
                <p>No, it’s very easy. Simply fill out a contact form and we will follow up with you, or email us directly simply stating that you would like a free consultation regarding sourcing in China. After the consultation, we’ll sign a partnership agreement and get to work.</p>

            <section class="faq-questions">
                <h2 id="long-price">How long does it take to get product prices from the factory?</h2>
                <p>We usually can get you product prices and all related product information within one to two weeks of partnering with Red Bridge Co..</p>
            </section>
            <section class="faq-questions">
                <h2 id="long-produce">How long will it take to produce my products?</h2>
                <p>Depending on the product and factory lead time, the typical order usually takes between 60 to 90 days to complete. However, some products may be completed in as little as 30 days from placing the order.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="faq-questions">
                <h2 id="sure-quality">How will I know for sure that the products produced are of good quality?</h2>
                <p>Red Bridge Co. employs a thorough quality control process throughout the entire production period. This may include inspection photos, videos, and at times in-person product inspections. A portion of the production is tested for quality and the entire production is not cleared for release unless we are certain the products meet your quality standards.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="faq-questions">
                <h2 id="safe">Is it safe to transfer money to China?</h2>
                <p>Yes. Bank transfers are very standard, safe, and secure..</p>
            </section>
            <section class="faq-questions">
                <h2 id="putdown">How much will I have to put down in order for manufacturing to start?</h2>
                <p>Industry-standard usually requires you to put 30% of the total purchase order down. However, like nearly everything in China, this is negotiable.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="faq-questions">
                <h2 id="poor-quality">What happens if I receive poor-quality products?</h2>
                <p>In the unlikely event this happens, we can negotiate a credit on the next order or a refund equivalent to the damage incurred. Our partner factories are usually reasonable in these situations and are happy to come to a mutually beneficial solution.</p>

            <section class="faq-questions">
                <h2 id="long-ship">How long will it take to ship my products from China to my address in the US?</h2>
